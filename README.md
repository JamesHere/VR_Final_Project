Untitled Shooting Game Plus.

Updated version of the midterm project: https://github.com/JamesHere/ATLS4519_VR_Midterm

Platform: Windows Mixed Reality

## Required:
Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Unity.Foundation.2.2.0.unitypackage

Visual Studio 2019

Unity 2018.4.x, 2019.1.x or 2019.2.x

Windows SDK 18362+.

Any older or newer version may break the game.

## Description
This final project is the improved version of the midterm project where the player needs to survive as long as they can and try to earn a high score. There will have many creeps spawned around the player and coming toward the player. There are swordman, ranger, and sniper. Each creep has different AI and behavior. The player can use the wand and sword to fight against them.

## New Features:
-Better collider detection, despawn logic, pathfinding.
-Play can use the sword to parry/block/deflect any incoming attack.
-Wand now has an ammo limit and will have charging time. But it shoots faster.
-The difficulty will increase base on the player's current score.
-Players can use the motion controller to teleport and turning around.
-Sword can do the melee attack.
-Hitting creeps with their own arrow will give you extra point.


## Assets
MOBA Hero Creep (trial version, so not complete animation) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zavOnZ7VNUI

Epic Toon Fx 1.31 (also trial version) https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/epic-toon-fx-57772

Custom Made

## Note
The original plan of the final project is to make a dungeon adventure game and use steamVR and openVR as the main toolkit. But openVR doesn't have good support on WMR's motion controller and have some mapping problems. I then used the WMR toolkit but the recent update also break up something. So I moved the new features to the original survival game for safety.

The game runs smooth but screen recorder will slow it down.
